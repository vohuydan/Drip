# Drip


Drip consists of two parts:
-Android Application
-Arduino Application

The android app connects to the Flora BLE on the Circuit Playground and can send/ recieve information. The android is the client and the Arduino is the server.

Drip contains a fully functioning water overflow detctor. One problem is that the BLE connection disconnects after being out of range.
