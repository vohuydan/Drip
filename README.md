# Drip


Drip consists of two parts:<br />
-Android Application<br />
-Arduino Application<br />

The android app connects to the Flora BLE on the Circuit Playground and can send/ recieve information. The android is the client and the Arduino is the server. Only the water detection level part has been implemented.

Drip contains a fully functioning water overflow detctor. One problem is that the BLE connection disconnects after being out of range.<br />
